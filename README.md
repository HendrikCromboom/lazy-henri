# Lazy Henri

### Intro

Let's be honest, developers are lazy ... well I know I am...

This usually shows in my unfathomable desire to automate things.

This little library is nothing more than just that...

---

### Use

To use the library add the following line before your own JS script:

`<script src="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/HendrikCromboom/lazy-henri/master/lazi-henri.js"></script>`

### Goal

To learn to create and use a library.

---

### Syntax

Lazy Henri is a JS library that uses vanilla syntax

* lz -> Every call to the library will start with lz for now

    * Arr -> Preset arrays will be defined with Arr: lzArrMonths will output ["January", "February", etc...]
    * Ran -> Preset randomisers will be defined with Ran: lzRanColor might output a string "blue" 
    
### Roadmap         

*Flesh out more arrays
*Flesh out more randomisers
